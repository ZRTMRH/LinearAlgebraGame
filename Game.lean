Title "Linear Algebra Game"
Introduction
"
# Welcome to the Linear Algebra Game!

This game works as a learning tool for linear algebra,
based on the textbook \"Linear Algebra Done Right\" by Sheldon Axler. It also serves as an
introduction to Lean 4, a proof assistant that provides an environment to encode proofs formally.

Proofs in Lean can are written in precise syntax, using tactics and theorems, and can be algorithmically
checked for correctness by a computer.

This game covers many areas of linear algebra, including vector spaces, linear independence, bases,
linear mappings, and isomorphisms.
