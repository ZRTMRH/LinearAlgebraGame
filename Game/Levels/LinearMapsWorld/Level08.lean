Title "Injectivity and Null Space (Axler 3.16)"

Introduction "
Now we'll prove one of the most fundamental theorems in linear algebra: **Axler's Theorem 3.16**.

## The Fundamental Theorem

A linear map $T : V \\to W$ is injective **if and only if** $\\text{null } T = \\{0\\}$.

## Why This Is Crucial

This theorem gives us a **practical test for injectivity**. Instead of checking the abstract definition (different inputs give different outputs), we can simply check if anything other than zero gets mapped to zero.

## The Two Directions

1. **If** $T$ is injective, **then** null $T = \\{0\\}$
2. **If** null $T = \\{0\\}$, **then** $T$ is injective

This is Axler's Theorem 3.16: *Suppose T ∈ L(V,W). Then T is injective if and only if null T = {0}.*

### Your Goal
Prove the first direction: if T is injective, then the null space is trivial.

**Educational Definition: Injective Linear Map**

A linear map is injective (one-to-one) if different inputs produce different outputs.

Following Axler's approach: T is injective if Tu = Tv implies u = v.

    rw [hv]
    simp [hT.2]

Conclusion "
You've proven half of Axler's fundamental theorem!

This direction shows that injectivity forces the null space to be as small as possible - containing only zero. Combined with the reverse direction, this gives us a complete characterization of when linear maps are injective.
