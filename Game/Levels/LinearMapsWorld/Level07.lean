Title "Surjective Linear Maps"

Introduction "
In our final level of LinearMapsWorld, we'll introduce the concept of surjectivity and prove a basic property.

## The Core Idea

A linear map is surjective (onto) if every element in the codomain can be reached. In other words, the range equals the entire codomain.

## Mathematical Definition

A linear map $T : V \\to W$ is surjective if:
$$\\text{range } T = W$$

This is equivalent to saying: for every $w \\in W$, there exists $v \\in V$ such that $T(v) = w$.

## Why This Matters

Surjectivity tells us when a linear map 'fills up' its target space completely. Combined with injectivity, it characterizes when linear maps are invertible.

### Your Goal
Prove that if T is surjective, then every element of W is in the range of T.

**Educational Definition: Surjective Linear Map**

A linear map is surjective (onto) if every element in the target space is hit.

Following Axler's approach: T is surjective if for every w ∈ W, there exists v ∈ V such that Tv = w.

    Hint "Since T is surjective, by definition there exists v such that T v = w. Use the surjectivity hypothesis directly."

  Hint "Second direction: if every w is in the range, then T is surjective. We assume every w is in the range and show surjectivity."
  · Hint "Introduce the range hypothesis and an arbitrary element w ∈ W to show surjectivity."
    Hint (hidden := true) "Try `intro h_range w`"
    intro h_range w
    Hint "The range hypothesis gives us exactly what we need - that w ∈ range means ∃ v, T v = w."
    Hint (hidden := true) "Try `exact h_range w`"
    exact h_range w

Conclusion "
You've connected surjectivity with the range!

You've now learned the fundamental concepts of linear maps: definition, null space, range, and the basic properties they satisfy. These form the foundation for understanding more advanced topics like the rank-nullity theorem and isomorphisms.

Congratulations on completing LinearMapsWorld!
