Title "The Range is a Subspace"

Introduction "
Just as we proved that the null space is always a subspace, we'll now prove that the range is also always a subspace.

## The Key Insight

The range of a linear map T : V → W is a subspace of the codomain W. This means we can apply all our subspace theory to understand the image of any linear map.

## Why This Matters

This result, combined with our null space theorem, shows that linear maps have a very structured behavior - both their 'input kernel' and 'output image' are subspaces.

## Proof Strategy

We need to verify the three subspace properties:
1. **Non-empty**: The range contains 0 (since T(0) = 0)
2. **Closed under addition**: If w₁, w₂ are in the range, so is w₁ + w₂
3. **Closed under scalar multiplication**: If w is in the range and a is a scalar, then a•w is in the range

### Your Goal
Prove that the range of any linear map is a subspace.

Conclusion "
You've proven that the range is always a subspace!

Now we know that both the null space and range of any linear map are subspaces. This gives us powerful tools for analyzing the structure and behavior of linear transformations.
