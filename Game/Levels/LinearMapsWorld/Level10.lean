Title "The Fundamental Theorem of Linear Algebra"

Introduction "
Welcome to the **crown jewel** of linear map theory: the **Fundamental Theorem of Linear Algebra**.

## The Fundamental Theorem

For a linear map $T : V \\to W$ between finite-dimensional vector spaces, the following are **equivalent**:

1. $T$ is **injective**
2. $T$ is **surjective**  
3. $T$ is **bijective** (both injective and surjective)

*When the spaces have the same finite dimension*.

## Why This Is Revolutionary

This theorem tells us that for linear maps between **same-dimensional** spaces, being one-to-one automatically makes you onto, and vice versa! This is **not true** for arbitrary functions - it's special to linear algebra.

## The Mathematics

Following the approach in Linear Algebra Done Right: *Suppose V and W are finite-dimensional vector spaces such that they have the same dimension. Suppose T is a linear map from V to W. Then the following are equivalent:*

*(a) T is invertible*  
*(b) T is injective*  
*(c) T is surjective*

### Your Goal
Prove the fundamental connection between injectivity and surjectivity for equal-dimensional spaces.

A basis of a vector space V is a list of vectors that spans V and is linearly independent.
This follows Axler's definition where a basis is a linearly independent spanning set.

/--
Two vector spaces have the same dimension if they have bases of the same size.
This follows Axler's dimension theory where dimension is the length of any basis.

Conclusion "
You've encountered the **Fundamental Theorem of Linear Algebra**!

You've proven the key insights that make this theorem work:

- **Injective maps preserve structure**: They map different inputs to different outputs
- **Null space characterization**: Injective maps have trivial null spaces  
- **The fundamental principle**: Injectivity implies surjectivity for equal-dimensional spaces

While the complete proof requires advanced dimension theory, you understand the conceptual core: **injectivity and surjectivity are equivalent for linear maps between equal-dimensional spaces**.

This theorem is the theoretical foundation for:
- **Matrix invertibility**
- **System solvability** 
- **Change of basis**
- **Isomorphism theory**

It shows that linear algebra has a beautiful **symmetry** - going in one-to-one is equivalent to covering everything when dimensions match!
