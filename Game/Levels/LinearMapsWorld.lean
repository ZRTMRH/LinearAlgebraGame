World "LinearMapsWorld"
Title "Linear Maps World"

Introduction "
Welcome to Linear Maps World! This world will introduce you to formalizing proofs about linear maps
in Lean. This world includes proofs about bases and dimension, for example if a subspace has the same
dimension as the whole space, it is the whole space.
