Title "Uniqueness of linear combinations"

Introduction "This is the \"boss level\" of the Linear Independence and Span World. This level is a
proof that in a linearly independent set, linear combinations are unique. There are also a few new tactics
and multiple new theorems you should use.

### The Goal
In this level, we have 5 objects and 6 hypotheses about those objects. We have the set `S : Set V`,
which is the linearly independent set we are working with. We also have `s` and `f`, which are the set
and function we are summing over to get the first linear combination, and `t` and `g` are the second
linear combination. We have `hs : linear_independent_v K V S`, which states that `S` is linearly independent,
`hs : ↑s ⊆ S` and `ht : ↑t ⊆ S`, which state that `s` and `t` are both in `S`, so are valid linear
combinations of `S`. We know `hf0 : ∀ v ∉ s, f v = 0` and a similar `hg0`, which state that both functions
are zero outside of their domain. This helps us prove `f = g`, since otherwise we wouldn't know what
the values of `f` and `g` would be outside of `s` and `t`. Lastly, we have `heq : Finset.sum s (fun v => f v • v) = Finset.sum t (fun v => g v • v)`,
which shows that the two linear combinations are equal. We then must pove that `f = g`

**Note:** This level may experience a hint display issue where hints repeat. If you see the same hint multiple times, the level is still working correctly - just continue with your proof as normal.

### The `specialize` tactic
The `specialize` tactic can be thought of as the opposite of `use`. While `use` helps specify a value
for a `∃` in the goal, `specialize` specifies a value for a `∀` in a hypothesis. For example, if you
have a hypothesis `h : ∀ v : V, v • 1 = v`, and you have a vector `x : V`, then `specialize h x` will
change `h` to `h : x • 1 = x`. `specialize` also works if `h` is an implication. If `h1 : P → Q` is a
hypothesis, and `h2 : P` is a proof of `P`, then `specialize h1 h2` will change `h2` to `h2 : Q`.

### The `by_cases` tactic
The `by_cases` tactic helps you prove something by cases. If you want to prove a statement about vectors
in `V`, but you want to split into cases where `v = 0` or `v ≠ 0`, `by_cases hv : v = 0` will split the
goal into two subgoals: one where you have a hypothesis `hv : v = 0`, and another where you have a hpyothesis
`hv : v ≠ 0`.

### The `funext` tactic
The `funext` tactic lets you prove statements about functions. It works similarly to the `intro` tactic,
where you introduce an arbitrary object, but instead of introducing from a `∀` statment, it works if
you have a goal of the form `f = g`, where `funext x` will change the goal to the form `f x = g x`, and
give you an arbitrary `x` in the domain of `f` and `g`.

### New theorems
This level requires multiple new theorems, particularly ones about Finsets and sums. There are two theorems
about vector spaces that can be proven quite easily, but they are still nice to have without needing
to prove them first. Instead of explaining them all here, you can look at them on the right side of
the screen. The new theorems are: `coe_union`, `union_subset`, `sub_smul`, 'sum_add_distrib', 'sum_sub_distrib',
`subset_union_left`, `subset_union_right`, `sum_subset`, `sub_eq_zero`, and `not_mem_union`.
If you need more theorems, you can either prove them in lemmas, or if you want, you can go to the world
select menu and turn \"Rules\" to \"none\", which should allow you to use any tactic or theorem in Lean.

### Proof overview
If you look at the hypotheses you have, the most important ones are that S is linearly independent and
that the two sums are equal. When you have a statement that a set is linearly independent, it is often
very helpful to try to find the correct set and function to sum over, then try to satisfy the assumptions
to prove that the function must be zero. Since the goal is to prove that `f = g`, maybe try to prove
instead that `f - g = 0`, so you can try proving the assumptions in `hS` with the function `f - g`. You
also need to pick the correct set to be summing over. Since this set must contain both `s` and `t`, you
can use `s ∪ t`. Also, note that this will then only prove that `f = g` on the set `s ∪ t`, so you may
need to use `by_cases` to prove it outside `s ∪ t`.

### Note on hints
With the use of `have` statements, you may have multiple goals at the same time. While this is not a
problem when writing the proof, the hint system may get confused. Starting to type where you
intend to write your next tactic will help clear up what goal you are working on, so it will help the hint
system. However, in general, try to follow your intuition without blindly following the hints.

## Summary
The `by_cases` tactic is able to create a new hypothesis, and split the goal into two cases: one where
the hypothesis is true, and one where the hypothesis is false.

In general, if you write `by_cases h : P`, you will create one goal with a hypothesis `h : P`, and another
with a hypothesis `h : ¬P`.

## Example
If you have some vector `v : V`, and some set `s : Set V`, you can solve the proof by cases of whether
v is in s by writing `by_cases h : v ∈ s`, which will give you two goals, one with the hypothesis `h : v ∈ s`,
and one with the hypothesis `h : v ∉ s`.

## Summary
The `funext` tactic is very helpful when dealing with functions. It uses the idea that for two functions
`f : A → B` and `g : A → B`, `f = g` if and only if `f x = g x` for all `x ∈ A`. This means that if you
have a goal `f = g`, where both functions have domain `A`, `funext x` will create an arbitrary `x : A`,
and change the goal to `f x = g x`.

## Summary
The `specialize` tactic can be thought of as the opposite of `use`. While `use` helps specify a value
for a `∃` in the goal, `specialize` specifies a value for a `∀` in a hypothesis. If you have a hypothesis
`h`, `specialize h x1 x2 x3` will specify the values in `h` as `x1`, `x2`, and `x3`.

## Example
If you have a hypothesis `h : ∀ x : V, f x = 0`, and some `v : V`, then `specialize h v` will
change the hypothesis to `h : f v = 0`

## Example
If you have a hypothesis `h : x ∈ s → f x = 0`, and another hypothesis `h2 : x ∈ s`, then `specialize h h2`
will change h to `h : f x = 0`

`coe_union` is a proof that `↑(a ∪ b) = ↑a ∪ ↑b`. The `↑` means type casting, which in this case
specifically means that if `a` is a `Finset`, then `↑a` is a `Set` containing the same elements. This
theorem shows that type casting passes through unions.

`sum_add_distrib` is a proof that you can distribute addition over sums. This means that if

`sum_subset` is a proof that if you have a function that is zero outside of some set, then a sum
on a superset of that set is equal to a sum on that set. If you have a hypothesis `hSub : a ⊆ b`, another hypothesis
`hZero : ∀ x ∈ b, x ∉ a → f x = 0`, then `sum_subset hSub hZero` is a proof that
`Finset.sum b f = Finset.sum a f`

`linear_combination_unique` is a proof that representation as a linear combination of a linearly independent
set of vectors is unique. It takes in two subsets of a linearly independent set, along with two functions
representing the linear combinations. The functions must be zero outside of the sets, and their sums
must be equal. In this case, this prooves that functions will be equal.
